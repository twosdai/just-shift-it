# Just Shift It

Just a simple script to copy all files from a directory to another one

# Running it

The below code, changes the script to be publically (any process can run it) accessible on the computer and then moves files from one directory to another. The current default being `/home/y-m-d-h-m-s` where the directory is the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second.

```
chmod +x ./shiftit.sh

sudo ./shifit.sh /some/cool/directory/path
```
